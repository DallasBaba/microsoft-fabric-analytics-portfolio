## Limitation 
Unable to connect Fabric workspace directly to Github because of account type limition. This is to demonstrates that syncing a Microsoft Fabric workspace to a Git repository is possible when using an enterprise account. My setup uses a student account, so full Git integration is not available in this environment. <strong> Reference :</strong> <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=azure-devops%2CAzure%2Ccommit-to-git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Get started with Git integration </a>
